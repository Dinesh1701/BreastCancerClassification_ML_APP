a. Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build and compare multiple Machine Learning classification models to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of different ML algorithms using multiple evaluation metrics and deploy the best-performing model using a Streamlit web application.

b. Dataset Description 

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset, obtained from Kaggle (UCI repository).

Dataset Details:

Total Instances: 569

Total Features: 30 numerical features

Target Variable: diagnosis

M → Malignant (1)

B → Benign (0)

Data Type: Numerical

Problem Type: Binary Classification

Preprocessing Steps:

Removed unnecessary id column

Removed empty columns (if any)

Converted categorical target (M/B) into numeric values (1/0)

Checked and handled missing values

Applied Standard Scaling before model training

d. Observations on Model Performance (3 Marks)
ML Model Name	Observation about Model Performance
Logistic Regression	Achieved the highest accuracy and AUC score. The dataset appears nearly linearly separable, making logistic regression highly effective.
Decision Tree	Lower performance compared to other models. Likely slight overfitting due to tree-based structure.
kNN	Performed well but slightly lower than logistic regression. Sensitive to feature scaling.
Naive Bayes	Strong performance despite independence assumption. Worked well on numerical dataset.
Random Forest	Stable and robust performance due to ensemble averaging. Reduced overfitting compared to Decision Tree.
XGBoost	Strong boosting performance, but slightly lower than Logistic Regression for this dataset.
